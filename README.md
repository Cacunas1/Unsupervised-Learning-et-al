# Unsupervised-Learning-et-al
Repo for storing code from the "Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders Systems and Reinforcement Learning" course.

This is course 3 out of 3 from the "Machine Learning Specialization" on Coursera. Deeplearning.ai created it.

The idea is to store all the code related to this course, for future reference (to use as guidance for future projects)
